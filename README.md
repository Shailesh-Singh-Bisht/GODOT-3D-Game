# Simple 3D Game Tutorial (Godot 4)

This is a basic 3D game made in Godot 4. It features a single-room environment with simple player movement—created purely as a learning project.

The game follows the excellent tutorial series by **Brackeys**, adapted for Godot 4.  
> Check out Brackeys on YouTube if you're learning game dev—absolute legend.

⚠️ This is not a full game. There is no combat, no objectives—just a clean foundation to learn 3D in Godot.

## 👨‍💻 Dev Note

This is my first 3D project in Godot, made to learn the basics of scene setup, movement, and exporting.  
It’s a simple start, but a big step. More to come. 🚀
